You can view it deployed [here](https://shengaero.github.io/).

## Acknowledgements

### Languages
- `TypeScript` - The main bulk of the application was done in TypeScript.
- `Sass`/`Scss` - My CSS derivative of choice.

### Frameworks
- `React` - This project was build `create-react-app` and uses `react-router-dom` plus various react wrapper libraries like `react-bootstrap`.
- `Bootstrap` - The CSS framework I used to build this website.
- `Node.js` - Used primarily for scripts and certain configuration files.

### Special Thanks
- [Rafgraph](https://github.com/rafgraph) - For [their hack](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) to get around gh-pages not working well with `BrowserRouter`.
- [My Past Self](https://github.com/shengaero/kgustave.me) - For being smart enough to solve the `BrowserRouter` issues as well as keeping the source code of a dead website around to help me fix them again 4 years later.
